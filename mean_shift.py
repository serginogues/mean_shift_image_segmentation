Mean-shift algorithm

- Get data points (with many features, i.e. RGB values)
- Choose feature (column of the data points vector)
- For each data-point/pixel/row:
    a) Init window of size r
    a.1) Apply Gaussian in window (to place more importance to the data points closest to density center)
    b) Implement findpeak() until convergence (peak is found):
        - Calculate mean within data points in window
        - Shift window center to the mean
        - repeat until peak found (data points equally distributed, mean = window center)
    c) Assign label to each point according to its peak (cluster it belongs to)
